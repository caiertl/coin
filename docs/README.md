### Fixer API token

Coin highly depends on Fixer, a _"foreign exchange rates and currency conversion
JSON API"_. Fixer gives a free tier that allows up to a 1000 requests per month.
In order to get an API key and use the service, an account is required. You can
sign up for a free account [here](https://fixer.io/signup/free).

The API key is a 32-length characters wide alphanumeric string. Coin must read
this API key in order to make the request and parse it. It will, by default,
try to read the key from the `FIXER_API_TOKEN`.

- __Export the API key:__

```sh
$ export FIXER_API_TOKEN="ys1r39m5zc71xpvdjpqsnrhwqtxe98cj"
```
